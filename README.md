# Timeline

## My plan
1. Find a game idea.
2. Push the concept quite far and details.
3. Now keep only 3 key points you want to focus on and remove every "little thing" you think it could be good to have cause you will never have the time :p
4. Choose your tech you are good at it and stick to it.
5. Use a maximum of free assets to accelerate your dev.

## What really happens
1. Find a game idea.
2. Push the concept quite far and details.
3. Now keep only 3 key points you want to focus on and remove every "little thing" you think it could be good to have cause you will never have the time :p
4. Tried to use new tech (Core games and Unreal Engine) with what I am not familiar with => downloading was too time-consuming.
5. Downgrade the idea to a maximum and keep only the essential => 3D with nice assets became a 2D game.
5. Use a maximum of free assets to accelerate your dev.

## Game idea 1: Let's pack for travel
### Scenario
> You are a lazy person who woke up too late before taking your plane. You have a limited time to pack all your important and less important stuff before missing the flight.

### Game design
It is an arcade game, the "travel destination and duration" could create a specific list of items to pack with a certain limit time.
* You can move into your house 
* You have to pick up most items before the time is up.
* You have required and non-required items to pick up
* Go to the front door before time is up.

## It became: Let's pack for a mission
### Scenario
> You are a ninja and you need to pack your stuff as fast as possible to go on a mission. But be careful, you let some makibishi on the floor...

### Game design
* Your house looks like a maze
* You start with 3 heart
* You lose 1 heart when you step on a makibishi
* Pick up all the kunai before ending the game

### Free assets I used
- [Ninja wepon set](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/ninja-wepon-set-90664)
- [Ninja sprite sheet](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/ninja-sprite-sheet-free-93901)
- [2d pixel item asset pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/2d-pixel-item-asset-pack-99645)

# Final results
Unfortunately, I wasn't really into it this year so [this](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/lets-pack-mission-4) is what I have done within 2 hours with Unity. But I had fun brainstorming with my brother and I think it's the first time I 100% agree with the first idea.
